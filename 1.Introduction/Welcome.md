What is Vue.js? 
- Vue is a progressive Javascript framework. You can use as little or as much as you need. You can add a small component to any app, or engulf entire application in Vue.js. 
- 3 selling points: approachable, versatile, performant

What is a framework? 
- building blocks (ex. wood,screws, nails, paint, etc when building a house. You can make radically different houses given the exact same building materials)
- Design pattern. Keep your mind on what you want to build then how we're going to build it. 
- Ready to use functionality
    - built-in libraries of pre-written functionality
    - Events, Templating, Bindings (two way binding when you type into an input field it automatically changes in your data layer)...
- Key Advantages: rapid development, cohesive designs and patterns (better for teams), scalable, easy to learn & implement

Approachable & Versatile
- Wrap an entire application or wrap 1 element
- Concise syntax, easy to understand
