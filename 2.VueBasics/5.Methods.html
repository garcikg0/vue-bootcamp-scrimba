<!-- Methods and computed properties are simple functions. The main difference between a computed property and a method is that a method does not have reactivity. A method needs to be triggered. -->
<!-- The way to trigger a method is with an event listener. Syntax to bind into an event in Vue is @click="methodName" -->
<!-- Computed properties are only re-rendered if the DOM needs to be re-rendered. If the diff is complete and no changes, then the computed property doesn't cost you a thing. However, when you have a method, it is always calculated and takes computational time -->
