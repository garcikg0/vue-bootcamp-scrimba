What is a component? 
- A component is the extraction of single elements (a single element of your app)

The purpose of components: 
- Reusablility of code (something you will use over and over, like buttons, without having to repeat code)
- Encapsulation (written code with complex logic that is only pertaining to one instance (i.e. the one button or the one element))
- A component can be big (entire view / whole application) or small (single element)
- Break app into small pieces. The small pieces are components

Component Features: 
- contain their own template, data, methods, computed, etc...
- serve as building blocks (of code)
- shareable across projects, teams and world (can open-source a component)
- fundamental core concept of Vue 

Hidden Advantages: 
- helps the DOM with Caching, only re-renders when necessary. Super fast updates to the DOM. Vue is smart on when to re-render a component. The smaller the component, the less they need to be re-rendered. 
- component scoped CSS (CSS that is only available inside the component); great for avoiding class collisions with large projects.
